# Hi there üëã

I am voidlesity, currently 16 years old, born on the 29th of January.
I am a Hobby Programmer and currently have an apprenticeship as an Application Developer.


## About me

My first programming language was C#, which I used to make games with in [Unity](https://unity.com/), even though I never published any besides one for a [school project](https://voidlesity.itch.io/alone-in-tokyo).
I am not very proud of it since I just didn't like the concept that we had, also it was never finished and probably will never be (since I deleted the project file).
You can still nonetheless play it I don't know why you would though.

I am not using Visual Studio anymore since I just love the UI, customizability, and extensions of VScode way more.
